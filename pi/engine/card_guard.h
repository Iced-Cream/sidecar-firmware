// pi/engine/card_guard.h - testcard=1 (docs/pi5.md "Engine test mode"): the engine runs on the boot partition of Raspberry
// Pi OS, which is not its own card. What it may change there: Sidecar's folders, nothing else. This is the rule; the
// gate is card_guard.cpp, which wraps FatFs's calls that change a name (the linker's --wrap, PI5_GADGET=1 builds only).
// A change to anything else is refused with FR_DENIED, so config.txt, cmdline.txt, the kernels, overlays/ and whatever
// else lies at the root stay as they are, whichever of the engine's paths asks (the file port's PUT and DEL too).
// Reads are not limited. Other drives (USB:, NVME:) are not this card. pi/engine/tests/test_card_guard.cpp runs it on the Mac.
