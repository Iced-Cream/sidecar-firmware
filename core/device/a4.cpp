// core/device/a4.cpp - see a4.h. Its mod reports as the Rytm's does, the engine's own 03 / 04 / 11 with P1..P16 and the machine in the voice byte, so the
// profile lists those commands and nothing is translated.
//
// The stream [read in OS 1.56]: host -> A4 6 channels / 200 B. 0, 1 MAIN: added to the effects' return on the DAC, after everything but the analog output
// stage, through USB TO MAIN's gain. 2..5 the synth voices: each added to that voice's own DAC word, the one its digital noise takes, so a Sidecar voice goes
// through the voice's analog filters and amp, and from there to the A4's chorus, delay and reverb: these are the per-channel insert points, as on the Rytm. The gain
// there follows the voice's amp, from 0.25 up, and the analog VCA must be open: a track that plays. A4 -> host 8 channels / 256 B: MAIN L R, the voices 1..4,
// INPUT L R (names from Overwitch; a unit showed MAIN on 0 / 1, its voices on theirs). The loop: 197 frames, 4.1 ms, a voice's tap to its channel on IN [measured on a unit, voice 1; 191 voice 3]. The driver widens that block to the
// 12 channels its consumers take: 0..5 as they are, 6..9 silent, INPUT on 10 / 11. So this row's `audio_in` is the wide block's.
