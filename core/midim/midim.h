// core/midim/midim.h - the MIDI machine (backlog 7o; Rytm machine 50, rytm-mods 0021 / 0026; docs/MIDI-MACHINE.md): a machine
// that sends MIDI instead of playing. No audio, no render time, no card: a track's trigs, notes and locks become MIDI on a
// chosen destination and channel. Reached through the note machines' entries (core/nmach.h), so a trig, a seq poly track's
// notes, the pads' and the keyboards' notes all arrive here as they reach MULTISAMPLE.
//
// P1..P16 (the Rytm's SRC and SMPL pages; every one a sound word: kits, sounds, p-locks, LFOs):
//   P1 DST  4 zones: OFF DIN USBC USBA        P2 CHAN 16 zones: 1..16
//   P3 BANK 0 OFF, n: CC 0 = n - 1            P4 SBNK 0 OFF, n: CC 32 = n - 1       P5 PROG 0 OFF, n: program n - 1
//   P6 PB   0 OFF, 1..127: 64 centre, 14 bits with the word's fraction
//   P7 AT   P8 MW (CC 1)  0 OFF, 1..127: 0..127
//   P9..P12 VAL1..4: 0..127   P13..P16 SEL1..4: 0 OFF, n: VALk sends on CC n - 1
//
// Sent: on a trig everything wanted that differs from what was last sent, BANK SBNK PROG (the three together: a bank needs its
// program) PB AT MW CCs, then the note; else what changed, under the byte budget (the newest value wins; notes never wait).
// Each voice's sent values are per destination and channel: a change of either sends all again.
// Held notes: a table of (destination, channel, note, voice, source). The off goes where the on went, whatever DST and CHAN say
// now, and only when no other holder of that note is left. A trig is mono on its voice. Nothing hangs: 0x11, the next trig,
// stop, machine or kit change, the link's hello each end what they own.
// DIN: F0 7D 52 54 4F 01 <status & 7F> <d1> [<d2>] F7 to the Rytm (rytm-mods 0026), which sends it on its MIDI OUT.
// A note-off a USB destination could not take (the platform's queue full) is tried again each tick for kOffRetryMs, unless the note was
// played again. A device that echoes (a DAW's MIDI thru, a device with its own thru) would bring each sent note back in through core/keys.h
// and out again for ever: echo() drops a note-on from a destination's own input that matches one sent there in the last kEchoMs, each sent
// note once. A loop slower than that is not caught; a fixed-velocity keyboard on the destination's port, on CHAN, repeating one key faster
// than that loses those repeats.
// LOST ON THE WAY. A DIN note-off is a record on the way to the Rytm: the merge drops every record while a failed send has the sending off (5-60 s,
// pi/engine/usbmidi_merge.h), a queue on the way can be full, and emit cannot tell. So DIN's note-offs are remembered, a set of (channel, note) kept
// kOffKeepMs of a link that is up, 128 notes on 16 channels with nothing to overflow. The platform calls resync() when records were lost and sending is on
// again (DropResync, the remote UI's resync: on the Pi, at most once a second): each remembered off goes again, under the byte budget, unless the note
// is held now. An off that did arrive and goes twice does nothing. link_state(false) stops the clock, so an off survives a link off for any time.
// The control side (the Pi's core 3): no card, no waiting, bounded work; between render blocks.
