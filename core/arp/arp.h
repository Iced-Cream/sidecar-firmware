// core/arp/arp.h - the arpeggiator (backlog 7ae; docs/ARP.md): a track's held or sequenced chord played as a pattern, in time with the
// Rytm. Any Sidecar machine, the MIDI machine (core/midim/midim.h) too: what a voice would have played goes into the voice's held
// notes here, and one note at a time comes out through inst::play_on (core/inst.h), the path every machine takes from the sequencer.
//
// In: a Rytm trig (held until its 0x11, its CHD chord on the machines with chord words), the sequencer's notes (inst::seq_on: held
// until their own off), the pads' and keyboards' live notes (poly.cpp live_start / live_release). With a voice's mode OFF nothing is
// taken and the voice plays as before. An off for a note not held here passes on: a note started before the arp came on ends as it would.
//
// Settings: per sound, a 10-bit code in the Rytm's sound (rytm-mods 0021, stored slot 46, live +0x6d and the two bits above the tag), so
// they are saved with sounds and kits and an old sound reads 0, OFF. The Rytm treats it as opaque: the reading of it is here.
//   code = mode + 6 x (speed + 6 x (range + 3 x (gate + 3 x swing))); fields stored so 0 is the default, values above kCodes - 1 read 0
//   Rytm -> host  45 01 <track> <code & 7F> <code >> 7>   after a hello, and when the active kit's sound changes (a kit, a load, a paste)
//                 ... and from ext_render just before a trig whose kit's code it has not said: a new kit's first step plays by its own code
//   host -> Rytm  45 01 <track> <code & 7F> <code >> 7>   the page's edit: the active kit's live sound and the project copy
// A voice shared by two tracks (RS / CP ...) takes the first of them with its mode on.
//
// Time: grid point n of interval g (1/16ths) falls at origin + n g + (n odd ? swing g : 0), from the sequencer's step clock (seq::beat_map),
// `latency` early as its own notes. Stopped, or with no ticks yet: free running from the first note at the last tempo reported. Each
// render block (seq::pre_block): the note's off, then what is due. A chord that starts just after a grid point (a trig always does:
// its report comes after its step) plays at once; else at the next point.
//
// Ending: the held notes empty: the note plays out its gate; a hold that ended before its first note (off the grid, short) plays that note then. STOP or pause: a trig's and the sequencer's notes go,
// keys and pads that are down run on, free. Another kit (a 3B naming the same kit is an open's: nothing), machine change, a voice's silence, the link gone, a mode set OFF:
// everything of the voice ends now, but a trig just made (the new kit's own step, reported before its 3B).
//
// Locks (docs/SEQUENCER.md "Arp locks"): a sequencer step locks any of the five settings (seq.h kLockArp), on a seq track only. lock() lays them over the
// voice's settings from the step until the next step, or until another step's set says otherwise; a voice with no lock runs the code above and nothing else.
// The code's values stay as they were. MODE locked on, the sound's OFF: the step's notes are held here, and end with the step. MODE locked OFF, the sound's on: the
// step's own notes play as if no arp, what was held rests and runs on after it. A note sounding keeps its own pitch for its off, whatever the lock does to the pattern.
//
// The control side (the Pi's core 3): between render blocks, no card, bounded work: pre_block does nothing while no voice runs,
// else at most kVoices clock reads, a sort of kHeld notes at each note.
